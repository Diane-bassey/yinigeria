                <p>As part of our drive to bridge the skill gap in the IT industry, YIN and NITDA started an program called Connect to Change initiative , this is aimed at reducing unemployment in the IT sector , the program was phased into two parts and currently Young innovators of Nigeria is implementing the State of IT skills gap Research which is the first phase this is aimed at efficiently tackling the problem of IT Skills gap in Nigeria, we need to have accurate information on the precise state of the skills gap in the sector. This can only be done through a proper research of the problem. A “state of IT skills gap” research will be conducted by means of a survey to gain a better understanding of the IT skills in demand and identify any existing or forthcoming IT skills shortages and gaps in the Nigerian IT sector.</p>
                <p>The objectives of the Research include:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Identify the extent of the unemployment rate in the IT sector</li>
                  <li>Identify which IT skills are and will be most important to businesses</li>
                  <li>Identify which skills the IT workforce currently possess</li>
                  <li>Identify the employers of IT skills in Nigeria</li>
